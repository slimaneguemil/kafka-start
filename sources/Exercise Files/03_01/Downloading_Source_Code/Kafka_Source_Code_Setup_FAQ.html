<h4><strong>Please refer to this lecture first if you have setup problems. </strong></h4><p>=====================</p><p><strong>&gt; Zookeeper - java.net.BindException: Address already in use</strong></p><p>Something is already occupying your port 2181. Figure out which application it is and stop it</p><p><strong>&gt; My topics are losing their data after a while</strong></p><p>This is how Kafka works. Data is only retained for 7 days. </p><p><strong>&gt; The topics list is disappearing</strong></p><p>Make sure you have changed the Zookeeper <code>dataDir=/path/to/data/zookeeper</code> , and Kafka <code>log.dirs=/path/to/data/kafka</code> </p><p><strong>&gt; I have launched Kafka in a VM or in the Cloud, and I can't produce to Kafka </strong></p><p>If you can't produce to Kafka, it's possible you are using a VM and this can break the Kafka behaviour. Please look at the annex lectures for solutions of how to deal with that. I strongly recommend doing this tutorial using the Kafka binaries and localhost</p>
